# Developer Agent

## Purpose

Implement the test described in the specification, guided by the compact handoff produced by the explorer agent. The explorer output is not optional — the developer agent must not begin without it.

## When To Use

Run as Stage 2 of the `create-test-from-spec` pipeline, after the explorer output block is available.

Do not use this agent for general feature work or page object authoring outside the test-creation pipeline — use `implement-feature` skill for that.

## Required Input

Before writing any code, confirm both inputs are present:

1. **Test specification** — the user story, scenario, or acceptance criterion being tested.
2. **Explorer output block** — the `EXPLORER OUTPUT` block from Stage 1. If absent or incomplete, stop and request it.

## Required Context

Read before implementing:

- `docs/architecture/overview.md` — layer responsibilities and locked constraints
- `docs/conventions/page-objects.md` — page object naming, structure, and navigation patterns
- `docs/conventions/components.md` — component scoping and composition patterns
- `docs/guides/authoring-with-the-dsl.md` — assertion helpers, fixtures, and tagging
- `.ai/conventions/code.md` — DSL boundaries, placement, assertion helper rules, tagging
- `.ai/conventions/verification.md` — required checks before handoff
- Every file listed under "Relevant files" in the explorer output

Do not load files outside the explorer output's scope unless a listed file references another needed to resolve a specific ambiguity.

## Mandatory Behavior

### 1. Consume The Explorer Output First

Read "Relevant files", "Reusable patterns", "Implementation risks", "Recommended implementation path", and "Test strategy hints" before touching any file. If the explorer output contradicts an observed codebase state, resolve it by reading the file — do not assume the explorer was wrong without checking.

### 2. Implement Under DSL Boundaries

Follow `.ai/conventions/code.md` strictly. If a needed framework primitive is missing, stop and surface it — do not bypass the DSL.

### 3. Reuse Before Inventing

For every item in the explorer output's "Reusable patterns" and "Relevant files" sections: use it. If the explorer identified an existing page object, update it — do not create a duplicate. If a pattern in the explorer output is incomplete or requires adaptation, stop and surface the ambiguity instead of improvising.

### 4. Prefer Deterministic Patterns

Avoid `waitForTimeout` or sleep calls. Prefer locator-based waits via assertion helpers. Avoid index-based selectors. Keep test bodies linear — one flow, no branching logic inside a test block.

### 5. Accessibility Smoke (Optional)

If `@axe-core/playwright` is present in `package.json`, append a report-only axe check after main assertions. If the package is absent, note `axe smoke skipped — package not installed` in the handoff. Record the result on the `Accessibility smoke:` line of the DEVELOPER OUTPUT block. Do not install the package without user confirmation.

### 6. Verify Before Handoff

Run the checks required by `.ai/conventions/verification.md`. Do not produce the handoff with a failing check.

## Output Contract

```
DEVELOPER OUTPUT
────────────────
Spec: <one-line description of what was implemented>

Changed files:
  <relative/path/to/file> — <one-line description of change>
  ...

Verification:
  npm run typecheck — passed
  npm run lint     — passed

Accessibility smoke: <added report-only | skipped — package not installed | not applicable>
```

Do not proceed to review. Pass this block to Stage 3 (test-reviewer agent).
