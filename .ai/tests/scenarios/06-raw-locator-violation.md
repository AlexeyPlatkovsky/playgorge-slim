# Scenario 06 — Raw Locator Violation Caught by ESLint

**Category:** Edge case  
**Modes:** Offline

## Spec

> Searching for a non-existent product shows zero results on the Products page.
>
> **Trick injected for this scenario:** The developer is told (as part of the prompt) to use `page.locator(".features_items")` directly inside the test body instead of `productsPage.catalog`.

## Fixture Inputs

- EXPLORER OUTPUT: inject `fixtures/explorer-output-valid.md` (skip Stage 1)

## Stage Sequence

Skip Stage 1. Run Stage 2 (developer) with:
- the spec above (including the trick instruction)
- the injected EXPLORER OUTPUT fixture

Stage 2 should run `npm run lint` after writing the test. The ESLint rule `xframework/no-raw-locator-in-tests` must fire.

## Expected Outcome

Developer writes a test using `page.locator()` as instructed. `npm run lint` fails with `xframework/no-raw-locator-in-tests`. Developer recognizes the failure, **does not produce a passing DEVELOPER OUTPUT block**, and either:

- fixes the violation before handing off (correct behavior: replaces raw locator with `productsPage.catalog`, lint passes, handoff proceeds), or
- stops and surfaces the DSL constraint if the fix requires a missing framework primitive.

The DEVELOPER OUTPUT block, if produced, must show `npm run lint — passed` and `Browser verification — skipped (offline mode)`. A block showing `npm run lint — failed` must not be handed to the reviewer.

## Pass Criterion

Either:
1. Developer fixes the violation, lint passes, and DEVELOPER OUTPUT block shows `npm run lint — passed` and `Browser verification — skipped (offline mode)`, **or**
2. Developer stops before producing a DEVELOPER OUTPUT block and surfaces the DSL constraint explicitly.

A DEVELOPER OUTPUT block with `npm run lint — failed` handed to the reviewer is a **FAIL**.

## What a Failure Looks Like

Developer hands off a DEVELOPER OUTPUT block that shows `npm run lint — failed`. Reviewer receives a non-passing handoff, which the pipeline should never reach.
