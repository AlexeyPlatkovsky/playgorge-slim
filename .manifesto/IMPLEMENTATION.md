# IMPLEMENTATION.md

## Purpose

This document defines how the agent-manifest framework realizes the values and principles in [MANIFEST.md](MANIFEST.md).

`MANIFEST.md` states what must be true. `IMPLEMENTATION.md` defines the practices, layers, gates, and file conventions that make those truths operational.

---

# Framework Sources

The framework has four source types:

- `MANIFEST.md` defines values and principles.
- `IMPLEMENTATION.md` defines framework mechanics.
- `NN_name.md` files define framework stages.
- `protocols/*.md` define framework protocols used by stages.

Framework protocols are not project runtime files. They are inputs for generating or reviewing project-local capabilities.

---

# Framework Stages

A stage is a framework prompt file named with the `NN_name.md` pattern.

Current stages:
- `00_project_profile.md`: create or update `.ai/docs/project_specification.md`
- `01_initial_composition.md`: build the initial instruction system
- `02_review.md`: audit an instruction system for compliance
- `03_capability_expansion.md`: add justified skills, pipelines, agents, rules, or docs
- `04_tool_adoption.md`: adopt an external tool into an existing instruction system

Stage rules:
- `00_project_profile.md` must run before any other stage
- stages 01-04 must stop if `.ai/docs/project_specification.md` is missing
- stages apply `MANIFEST.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION.md`, framework protocols, and the project specification together
- stage files are not project runtime artifacts

---

# Project Landscape

Generated or reviewed instruction systems use these layers when justified by the project.

## Project Profile

The project profile is the reusable specification stored at `.ai/docs/project_specification.md`.

Rules:
- it is created or updated by `00_project_profile.md`
- it records the user's role, recurring duties, AI tools, capability triggers, quality expectations, authoritative sources, domain vocabulary, and accepted assumptions
- stages 01-04 must read it before acting
- if it is missing, stages 01-04 must stop and require `00_project_profile.md`
- it is project knowledge, not a behavioral rule

## Root Contract

The root contract is the always-loaded policy layer. It classifies tasks, enforces gates, defines constraints, and routes work. It does not execute task procedures.

For single-tool projects:
- the selected tool's official native entrypoint may hold the full operational contract
- the native entrypoint must be verified against current official documentation during composition
- supporting artifacts should use the selected tool's native structure by default
- `AGENTS.md` is not required

For multi-tool or AI-agnostic projects:
- `AGENTS.md` is the canonical root operational contract
- every tool-specific entry file must be a thin adapter
- each adapter must instruct the tool to follow `AGENTS.md` strictly
- no tool-specific file may become a second source of truth

Shared multi-tool storage uses:
- `.ai/agents`
- `.ai/docs`
- `.ai/pipelines`
- `.ai/rules`
- `.ai/skills`

The framework-standard shared skill format is `.ai/skills/<skill_name>/SKILL.md` using markdown with Claude-style YAML frontmatter. At minimum, the frontmatter must include `name` and `description`.

If a project already stores capabilities elsewhere, migration is a structural refactor and requires user approval.

## Skills

Skills are atomic execution capabilities.

Rules:
- one responsibility
- no orchestration logic
- no cross-skill routing
- no duplicated root policy
- standalone project-local behavior

## Pipelines

Pipelines are ordered orchestration for non-trivial work.

Rules:
- pure sequencing only
- reference skills or agents
- do not redefine skill behavior
- include validation for non-trivial work
- use one file per pipeline when more than one pipeline exists or when a pipeline is substantial

## Agents

Agents are specialized roles used only when context isolation or specialized reasoning is clearly justified.

Rules:
- do not create a default agent layer without evidence of need
- keep agent responsibilities distinct from skills and pipelines
- use agents for isolation, specialization, or parallel responsibility, not decoration

## Rules

Rules are shared best-practice standards referenced by multiple skills or agents.

Rules:
- create a rule only when at least two skills or agents need the same statements
- never create a rule for one skill only
- define how to approach a category of work, not how to perform one task
- skills and agents reference rules instead of copying them
- in multi-tool or AI-agnostic projects, store shared rules under `.ai/rules`

Consistency between skills is an emergent property of sharing the same rule source.

## Reference Docs

Reference docs hold reusable project knowledge.

Rules:
- use docs for facts such as architecture, commands, domain context, and repository structure
- keep docs on demand, not always loaded
- do not use docs to enforce behavior that belongs in the root contract, a skill, a pipeline, an agent, or a rule

# Principle Implementation

## Context And Simplicity

### 1. Load Only What You Need

Implementation:
- keep the root contract small and policy-focused
- load skills, pipelines, agents, rules, and docs only when relevant
- avoid placing task-specific instructions in always-loaded files
- split large instruction files when they are large because they have multiple jobs

The 150-line target remains a strong guideline for instruction files, not a hard cap. Do not sacrifice clarity, correctness, or single responsibility just to satisfy the target.

### 2. Build For Now, Not For Later

Implementation:
- create only artifacts the current project actually needs
- reuse good existing project capabilities before adding new ones
- preserve existing naming when it is already coherent
- add configurability only when the current project requires it
- generalize only after a repeated pattern exists

### 3. Escalate Only When Justified

Classify work by complexity and risk.

Complexity:
- trivial
- non-trivial

Risk:
- low
- medium
- high
- system-level

Execution expectation:
- trivial + low risk: direct execution
- non-trivial + low or medium risk: pipeline plus validation
- non-trivial + high risk: pipeline plus stronger review
- system-level: strongest available routing path

Translate this matrix into mandatory gate language in the root contract. Do not copy the matrix itself into generated root contracts.

## Authority And Structure

### 4. Give Every Artifact One Job

Implementation:
- root contract: policy and routing gates
- skill: atomic task execution
- pipeline: ordered orchestration
- agent: specialized role or isolated context
- rule: shared best-practice standard
- reference doc: reusable project knowledge

If a file grows because it is doing too many jobs, split it rather than expanding it indefinitely.

### 5. Separate Policy From Execution

Implementation:
- put classification, routing gates, constraints, and required outputs in the root contract
- put task procedures in skills
- put sequencing in pipelines
- put specialized role behavior in agents
- keep project knowledge in docs and shared best-practice standards in rules

Execution skills must not contain manager handoff text, stage metadata, or routing to other skills.

### 6. Keep One Source Of Truth

Implementation:
- centralize each rule in the layer responsible for it
- reference rules and docs instead of copying their text into skills or agents
- derive project capabilities from framework protocol metadata, not from memorized protocol names
- do not let project skills depend on framework protocol files or framework-only paths at runtime

### 7. Respect Existing Authority

If an existing project capability exactly satisfies a required capability, reuse it.

An exact match means:
- the responsibility matches
- required framework protocol coverage matches
- no contradiction with the framework exists

If an existing capability is only close:
- treat it as non-equivalent
- stop and ask the user whether to split, preserve, replace, or create another artifact

Use the project's existing capability names when they already satisfy the framework. Do not create a near-duplicate capability just to match a canonical protocol filename.

If a project-native name fulfills a protocol:
- keep the project-native name
- note the protocol mapping once in the root contract or review report

If the naming convention is unclear or conflicts with framework defaults, ask the user.

## Control And Safety

### 8. Make Behavior Explicit

Before non-trivial implementation:
- state assumptions explicitly
- surface ambiguity instead of guessing
- define success criteria
- name intended verification

Avoid descriptive routing without a stop gate, implied validation, and implied completion behavior.

### 9. Gates Must Actually Gate

For non-trivial tasks, the root contract must use imperative blocking language.

Compliant pattern:
- classify the task first
- if trivial: proceed directly and state the classification
- if non-trivial: stop, load the concrete routing capability, and do not implement until routing resolves
- if unsure: treat as non-trivial

Routing gates must appear before the capability registry.

Validation is mandatory for non-trivial work:
- every non-trivial pipeline must include at least one explicit validation step
- stronger review loops apply only for higher-risk work
- validation should be automated and repeatable where possible
- `task-complete` is the required closure skill for non-trivial work
- `task-complete` enforcement should be centralized in the routing layer, not repeated across execution skills

### 10. Ask Before You Cut

If compliance or implementation requires a risky change, stop and ask the user before changing it.

Risky changes include:
- moving capabilities to a new directory
- splitting a monolithic file
- merging or deleting duplicated artifacts
- renaming or replacing existing capabilities
- choosing between multiple valid implementation contracts

When asking, explain:
- what should change
- why the change is needed
- what the safe target state would be

# Framework Protocol Contract

Protocols in `protocols/` are canonical framework inputs. They are not project runtime files.

Every protocol must declare structured frontmatter:
- `implementation: mandatory | optional`
- `requires_when: [...]`

Protocol frontmatter is authoritative for derivation and review. Prompt logic must not infer applicability from prose when metadata is present.

Each protocol body must define:
- purpose
- mandatory rules that implementations must preserve
- allowed project-specific adaptations
- output contracts, when applicable

## Capability Derivation

Capability derivation must come from canonical protocol metadata.

Rules:
- only protocols whose `requires_when` trigger is present may require implementation
- `protocols/_README.md` is an index of available protocols and must not participate in capability derivation
- protocols marked `implementation: mandatory` define required project capabilities when their trigger is present
- protocols marked `implementation: optional` may be implemented only when their trigger is present and the project genuinely needs them

Generated project skills must:
- be standalone project artifacts
- include the protocol's mandatory behavior
- include minimal project-specific adaptation
- avoid references to framework files, protocol files, or framework-only paths

For multi-tool or AI-agnostic projects, generated project skills must use the framework-standard skill format defined above.

---

# Capability Triggers

Prefer the smallest coherent system that satisfies the triggers actually present in the project profile and repository evidence.

Use these triggers:
- multiple AI tools or AI-agnostic portability need: root contract plus thin adapters
- open design decisions or setup/profile clarification choices with trade-offs: brainstorming capability
- non-trivial routed work: validation and task-complete capability
- routing must choose between multiple skills, pipelines, or agents: manager-equivalent capability
- repeated multi-step workflow: pipeline
- repeated task type: skill
- repeated best-practice statements across skills or agents: project rule
- reusable project facts such as architecture, commands, domain vocabulary, or source locations: reference doc
- context isolation or specialized reasoning need: agent
- high-risk or system-level work: stronger review and validation gates

Do not create managers, pipelines, agents, rules, or docs by default. Create them only when a concrete trigger exists.

---

# Final Rule

Reject, defer, or redesign any proposed change that:
- adds unnecessary always-loaded context
- duplicates an existing source of truth
- creates a competing authority
- introduces orchestration where direct execution would suffice
- forces a risky change without user approval
