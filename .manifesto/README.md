# AI Instruction Framework

The Agent Manifesto is a portable, tool-agnostic framework for organizing AI instruction systems. `MANIFEST.md` defines the framework's values and principles; `IMPLEMENTATION.md` defines the practices that apply them. Together they keep instruction systems minimal, explicit, and scalable across single-tool and multi-tool environments.

---

## How To Use

The framework is delivered as a set of stages. A stage is any `NN_name.md` file. Each stage is self-contained — attach or reference it in your AI tool and ask the tool to run it. The exact syntax depends on your tool (`@file` in Claude Code, Cursor, and most modern agents), but the idea is the same across all of them:

> `run @<stage-file>.md`

Run `00_project_profile.md` before any other stage. After that, pick the stage that matches your current situation.

---

### Stage 00 — Profile The Project

**When:** before any other framework stage, or when the user's role, duties, tools, or project assumptions changed.

**Run:**
```
run @00_project_profile.md
```

**What happens:**
- The AI captures the project purpose, user role, recurring duties, and AI tool surface.
- It identifies authoritative local sources, domain vocabulary, and quality expectations.
- It optionally researches current best practices when local context is insufficient and the user approves.

**Outcome:** `.ai/docs/project_specification.md`, the reusable profile required by every later stage.

---

### Stage 01 — Compose The Initial System

**When:** starting from scratch, or refactoring an existing messy instruction system.

**Run:**
```
run @01_initial_composition.md
```

**What happens:**
- The AI inventories your repository.
- It reads `.ai/docs/project_specification.md`.
- It asks only unresolved design questions needed for composition.
- It derives required capabilities from protocol metadata.
- It preserves good existing capability names where they already satisfy the framework.
- It asks before any risky change (splits, moves, merges, deletions, contract choices).

**Outcome:** the smallest coherent instruction system that fully aligns with `MANIFEST.md` and `IMPLEMENTATION.md`.

---

### Stage 02 — Review For Compliance

**When:** after significant instruction changes, or when you want a compliance check on an existing system.

**Run:**
```
run @02_review.md
```

**What happens:**
- Validates the correct root-contract model.
- Checks routing gates, duplication, and responsibility boundaries.
- Verifies protocol coverage from structured metadata.
- Produces a minimal fix plan before any implementation.

**Outcome:** a validated instruction system and a short, targeted list of fixes if anything is off.

---

### Stage 03 — Expand Capabilities

**When:** a valid baseline already exists and the team has real recurring workflows to encode.

**Run:**
```
run @03_capability_expansion.md
```

**What happens:**
- Learns recurring work directly from you.
- Proposes new skills, pipelines, agents, rules, and docs grounded in actual usage.
- Materializes newly-triggered mandatory protocols as standalone skills when new capability triggers appear.

**Outcome:** an instruction system that reflects how your team actually works, without speculative abstractions.

---

### Stage 04 — Adopt External Tools

**When:** adopting a specific external tool, library, or framework into an existing instruction system.

**Run:**
```
run @04_tool_adoption.md
```

**What happens:**
- Inventories the tool's runtime surface, demos, and foreign instruction artifacts.
- Reconciles foreign skills into standalone project skills, wrapped libraries, references, or discards.
- Enforces cleanup of demo content and broken imports before completion.

**Outcome:** the external tool is cleanly integrated, with no leftover demo noise or conflicting instructions.

## Core Model

This framework supports two root-contract modes:

- **Single-tool projects:** the selected AI tool's official native entrypoint may hold the full project contract.
- **Multi-tool or AI-agnostic projects:** `AGENTS.md` is the canonical root contract, and tool-specific files are thin adapters.

For multi-tool shared storage, the default layout is:
- `.ai/agents`
- `.ai/docs`
- `.ai/pipelines`
- `.ai/rules`
- `.ai/skills`

Project skills are standalone project artifacts. They are derived from framework protocols during composition, but they must not reference framework protocol files at runtime.

Project rules are shared best-practice standards referenced by multiple skills or agents. They belong in `.ai/rules` only when at least two skills or agents need the same statements.

The project profile is stored at `.ai/docs/project_specification.md`. Stages 01-04 must stop if it is missing.

In multi-tool or AI-agnostic projects, the framework-standard skill format is:
- `.ai/skills/<skill_name>/SKILL.md`
- Claude-style YAML frontmatter with at least `name` and `description`

Single-tool projects should still use the selected tool's native supporting-artifact structure.

---

## Protocol Metadata

Protocol frontmatter is authoritative for derivation and review.

Each protocol declares:
- `implementation: mandatory | optional`
- `requires_when: [...]`

In the bundled protocol set:
- `brainstorm` is mandatory when open design decisions or setup/profile clarifications require choosing between meaningful options
- `task-complete` is mandatory for non-trivial routed work
- `manager` is mandatory when routing must choose between multiple capabilities or centralize validation/completion

---

## Capability Triggers

The framework derives structure from concrete triggers, not broad labels.

- multiple AI tools or portability need → root contract plus thin adapters
- open design decisions or setup/profile clarification choices → brainstorming capability
- non-trivial routed work → validation and task completion
- routing across multiple capabilities → manager-equivalent routing
- repeated multi-step workflow → pipeline
- repeated task type → skill
- shared standards across skills or agents → project rule
- reusable project facts → reference doc
- context isolation or specialized reasoning → agent

---

## Operating Rules

- Keep instruction files near 150 lines when possible without harming quality.
- Prefer minimal, surgical changes that trace directly to the user's request.
- Keep execution skills isolated from orchestration.
- Use `pipeline` terminology consistently.
- Do not duplicate rules across root contracts, skills, pipelines, agents, rules, or docs.
- Do not perform risky changes silently.
