# brainstorm.md

## Purpose

This protocol defines canonical brainstorming behavior for framework-driven projects.

It is a framework input.
Project skills derived from it must be standalone project artifacts.

---

# Mandatory Implementation Rules

Any project skill derived from this protocol must:
- preserve the one-question-at-a-time contract
- present 2-3 concrete options for every question
- surface trade-offs and risks explicitly
- stop and wait after each question
- keep brainstorming separate from execution
- end the brainstorming phase with a decision summary before execution begins

The generated project skill may add minimal project-specific adaptation, examples, or terminology.
It must not weaken these rules.

---

# When Brainstorming Applies

Brainstorming applies when:
- a design decision is still open
- multiple valid approaches exist
- trade-offs need explicit evaluation
- setup, profile, or workflow clarification requires the user to choose between meaningful options
- the user has not committed to a direction yet

Brainstorming does not apply:
- during execution
- after a decision is already confirmed
- for purely factual questions that do not require choosing between meaningful options

---

# Core Rules

## 1. One Question at a Time

Ask exactly one question per turn.

Do not bundle questions.
Do not ask a follow-up in the same message.

## 2. Always Provide Options

For every question, provide 2-3 concrete, comparable options.

Options must be:
- distinct
- actionable
- specific enough to compare

## 3. Always Highlight Trade-Offs

State what each option optimizes for, what it sacrifices, and what risks or bottlenecks it carries.

Do not present options as equally valid when they are not.

For setup or profile clarification, keep trade-off notes brief and practical. Explain the likely impact of each option without expanding factual profile capture into broad design analysis.

## 4. Stop and Wait

After asking the question:
- explicitly ask the user to choose or clarify
- stop
- wait for input before moving on

## 5. Never Mix Brainstorming with Execution

During brainstorming:
- do not create files
- do not edit instructions
- do not implement

Brainstorming produces decisions, not artifacts.

## 6. The User Decides

The AI presents options and trade-offs.
The user makes the decision.

Do not assume a decision was made implicitly.

## 7. Focus on High-Impact Decisions

Ask only about decisions that materially affect:
- routing
- orchestration
- validation
- structure
- reusable documentation
- capability triggers

---

# Output Contract

At the end of a brainstorming phase, produce a decision summary that includes:
- each decision made
- the selected option
- any caveats or constraints noted by the user

Execution may begin only after the user confirms that summary.
